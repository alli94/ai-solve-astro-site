# First Draft for AI SOLVE Site
These are the most updated site changes for AI SOLVE as of 07/09/2024. The next steps will be to build out new components for the site.
I've created a new repo with these files here which will soon be moved to the RD Partners repo for ease of collaborative work.


## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
